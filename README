# Lamb Calculus 
## the repository formally known as Î»calc

This is a interpreter for Lambda Calculus built using Haskell.

###LambdaCalc.hs
Where are things relating to applying and creating functions comes from

###LambdaBool.hs
Where constants for true and false are kept, as well as boolean functions like not, and, or

###LambdaNum.hs (WIP)
Where integers stored in Lambdas are kept. There is a function that perfectly turns a number into a Lambda function, however, converting back or doing math does not currently work properly. However, isZero works perfectly fine.

##Un-accomplished work:

###LambdaCalc.hs
add Read function that interprets input

###LambdaBool.hs
add more functions that can be applied. Find a way to get around using variables when they are called, and x y = --> and = 

###LambdaNum.hs
figure out why exp isn't working as intended.
